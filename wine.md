Bot Auth Scopes in Slack define what your bot can and cannot do within a workspace. They specify the permissions needed for the bot to perform its intended functions, such as reading messages, posting messages, or accessing user data. Choosing the right scopes is crucial for ensuring your bot has the necessary access without requesting excessive permissions, aligning with the principle of least privilege.

Below is a table that outlines some of the commonly used bot auth scopes in Slack, their purposes, and when to use them. This list is not exhaustive but covers a range of common functionalities bots might need.

| `commands` | Add slash commands to Slack | If your bot uses custom slash commands for users to interact with it. |

| `groups:read` | View basic information about private channels that your bot is a member of | Similar to `channels:read`, but for private channels or groups. |

| `users:read.email` | Access userâ€™s email addresses | Necessary when your bot must use or display user emails, for instance, for identification outside Slack or integrating with other systems. |
| `app_mentions:read` | View messages that directly mention your app or bot in conversations that the app is in | To trigger bot actions or responses when mentioned by users in channels or DMs. |

### Choosing the Right Scopes
- **Understand Your Bot's Needs**: Analyze what your bot needs to do and select scopes that match these functionalities.
- **Start Minimal**: Begin with the minimal set of permissions and add more as required.
- **Consider Privacy and Security**: More permissions mean more responsibility for handling data securely and respecting user privacy.
- **Review and Adjust**: As your bot evolves, periodically review its scopes to ensure they are still necessary and appropriate for its functionality.

When configuring your Slack app, it's important to balance functionality with security and user trust. Always request the least amount of access necessary for your bot to function as intended.
